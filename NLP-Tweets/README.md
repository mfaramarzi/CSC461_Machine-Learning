ABSTRACT
The objective of this project was to train a model, able to judge if a tweet has a negative, neutral or positive sentiment regarding the Covid-10 subject. For this purpose fastai as a high level framework in deep learning was applied to construct the desired Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. This framework self contains the state of art algorithms for text preprocessing, language modeling and text classifying. As a result, it was a functional tool to produce a relatively accurate, covid-19 sentiment classifier, with minimum lines of coding. Preprocessed data were used to make a language model and the obtained language model was used as an encoder to train the classifier. Hyper parameters were optimized and accuracies of best combinations of them were compared. The best classifier with highest accuracy was used to conduct some analysis on the covid tweets and results were visualized at the end.
